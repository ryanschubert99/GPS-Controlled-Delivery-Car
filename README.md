# GPS-Controlled-Delivery-Car
## Abstract
The autonomous robotic delivery project focuses on designing and developing a Global
Positioning System (GPS) guided remote controlled vehicle capable of autonomous food
delivery on a college campus. This system addresses the need for improved time management
and convenience among students and faculty by enabling users to schedule food pickups and
deliveries in advance through the Delivery App coded and campus Grubhub. The vehicle will
operate autonomously, navigating through a nodal network while avoiding obstacles to ensure
efficiency and timely delivery. A multidisciplinary team of mechanical, electrical, and computer
engineering students will collaborate on the design and integration of the car‚Äôs physical frame,
navigation software, and hardware systems. The Fall 2024 semester concentrated on planning,
designing, and prototyping the project while the Spring 2025 semester focused on finalizing the
prototype to engineer a fully functional project. The project emphasizes cross-disciplinary
collaboration, real-world problem solving, and the implementation of autonomous systems in
everyday scenarios.
